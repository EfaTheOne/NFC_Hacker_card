# NFC_Hacker_card
This is a cool modern business card that I can use to show others my LinkedIn and GitHub to show what I've been working on. On the back, it has a bunch of logos of old businesses or projects that make me have some good nostalgia. The card also features my email, and the QRcode  also links to my LinkedIn.
